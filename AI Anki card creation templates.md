Formatting Criteria: 
- Construct a table with two columns: "Statements" and "Number".
- Each row of the "Statements" column should contain a single statement written in Anki cloze deletion mark-up, focusing on...(What you want it to focus on)
- The "Number" column should serve to number each row, facilitating feedback.

Reference Criteria for each "Statement":
- Restrict each statement to 2 cloze deletions. If needed, you may add 1-2 more cloze deletions but restrict them to either cloze1 or cloze2.
- Limit the word count of each statement to less than 40 words.
- Keep the text within the cloze deletions limited to one or two key words.
- Each statement must be able to stand alone. Include the subject of the statement somewhere in the text.
- Keep ONLY simple, direct, cloze deletion statements in the "Statements" column.

Example: 
| Statements | Number |
